# LabVIEW_adapter
This documentation describes the LabVIEW_adapter

# Infrastructure overview

A PV/ wind turbine/battery hybrid residential microgrid is emulated in AAU IoT-microgrid Lab. Two GORENJE smart appliances are included in the residential microgrid. The residential microgrid is assumed to supply power to EV chargers at three parking slots. Parking slot usage data, energy consumption data, operation status of the smart appliances, and room usage data are collected to the LabVIEW-based energy management system through VICINITY P2P network. The real-time charging price is calculated by considering the forecasts of the PV and wind turbine power generation, forecast of the load consumption, and state-of-charge of batteries. The parking slot usage, the real-time charging price, room usage date, microgrid operation status, abnormal situation alarm, and energy consumption abnormal alarm will be published to VICINITY Cloud. 
The adapter serves as the interface between VICINITY and the LabVIEW-based energy management system to enable the required interaction patterns.

# Configuration and deployment

Adapter runs on Python 3.6.

# Adapter changelog by version
Adapter releases are as aau_adapter_x.y.z.py

## 1.0.0
Start version, it works with agent-service-full-0.6.3.jar, and it subscribes to the event of GORENJE oven #7 device status and publishes an event with energy consumption abnormal notification. 

# Functionality and API
## User can read the energy consumption.

            GET : /remote/device/{oid}/properties/{pid}
### Return:
After executing GET method, a response can be received, for instance:
properties/Load_ActivePower
{  
    "value": "5",  
    "time": "2018-11-10 11:30:29"  
}
